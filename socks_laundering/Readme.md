# The challenge
A complete description of this kata can be found [here](https://app.codility.com/programmers/trainings/3/socks_laundering/).
For this implementation, my main areas of focus were the following:
- Triying a new approach for TDD, thinking about the logical steps to solve the problem at hand first and implementing a test for each step later (see the section "Problem approach" below for more details).
- Testing my newfound Ruby skills, as I'm just starting to learn this language.

# Problem approach
This kata was inspired by the feedback received in a technical interview, which encouraged me to think of TDD in terms of steps to solve the problem and try not to spend too much time "in the red".
I tried to think of a big-picture solution of the problem and came out with the following logical steps:
1. Find all matched pairs of clean socks, since we don't need to use the washing machine's capacity to clean them â€“they are just ready to go!
2. Find all possible pairs of one-clean and one-dirty sock, since we only need to use 1 unit of washing machine capacity to produce a clean pair.
3. Find all matched pairs of dirty socks, which would require 2 units of washing machine capacity to produce a clean pair.

When designing the test, I included the three main functionalities along the following requirements:
- The socks that are already paired and clean should be deleted from the original arrays, so they aren't counted twice.
- Washing machine capacity should be reduced with each sock it cleans.
- The program should stop matching socks when there is no washing machine capacity left.
In the end, I feel that the steps between passing a test and implementing the following one where still quite big, but I'm not sure if this is due to the test methodology or because I'm working with a new-to-me language such as Ruby.

# Next steps
- Try to find more edge cases to test and make sure the solution is correct.
- Refactor as I learn more Ruby! In particular, I'd like to find a solution that doesn't mutate the class properties.
